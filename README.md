A crucial part of both computer vision and self-driving cars is lane line detection. To reduce the risk of accessing another lane and to indicate the path for self-driving automobiles, this concept is implemented.
In order to recognize lane lines spontaneously, I have built a Machine learning project. Iwill accomplish this using the OpenCV library and computer vision principles.
